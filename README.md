# 42HN Piscine - May 2025 🏊‍♂️

This repository contains my solutions from the **May 2025 Piscine** at 42 Heilbronn.  
It includes exercises from **C00** to **C09**.

## 📘 Contents

These projects mainly consist of re-implementing standard C library functions and solving algorithmic challenges using only allowed low-level tools. Topics include:

- Character and string manipulation
- Loops and recursion
- Pointers and arrays
- Memory allocation (`malloc`)
- Custom libraries and Makefiles
